= RubyPorts -- a hookin-based ports system for Ruby

Copyright (C) 2008 Christian Neukirchen <purl.org/net/chneukirchen>

RubyPorts is freely distributable under the terms of an MIT-style license.
See COPYING or http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php.

== How to install

Run <tt>hook-bin.rb</tt> and add the <tt>bin</tt> directory to your path.

You need curl(1) to fetch packages over HTTP.
You need tar(1) to unpack packages.
You need svn, darcs, and git to check out package repositories.

You need a development tool chain installed if you want to build
extensions.  RubyPorts does not provide binaries.

== How to use

Usually, you will want to use RubyPorts directly from the Git checkout.
Periodically call <tt>git pull</tt> to keep your ports tree fresh.

Use <tt>ls -1 ports/*/*.rport</tt> to get a list of available ports.

To install a port, simply type <tt>hook-get.rb /path/to/portsfile.rport</tt>
to automatically download, build and hookin the port.  Dependencies
will be installed automatically if possible.  You can also try to type
<tt>hook-get.rb portname</tt> and hook-get will try to figure out what
you want to install.  Note that this can install unstable and even
broken development versions of your code; you may wish to provide a
version number as well.

Periodically call <tt>hook-bin.rb</tt> to update the symlinks in
<tt>bin</tt>.

Set the environment variable $RUBYPORTS to the full path of the
"ports" directory if you want to call hook-get from any location.

== How RubyPorts works

Every port consists of a .rport-file that contains download and
building instructions.  It looks like this:

    # A package-line declaring the package name and version (no
    # version if it packages the trunk).
    # This defines the pkgpath as "mongrel-1.1.3".
    package 'mongrel', '1.1.3'

    # A list of dependencies, as by the versioning convention.
    depend 'fastthread-1.0.1...'
    depend 'daemons-1.0.3...'

    # A source, which can be:
    # tar_gz URL:: a tar.gz unpacking(!) into pkgpath
    # tar_bz2 URL:: a tar.bz2 unpacking(!) into pkgpath
    # gem URL:: a URL to a .gem file unpacked to pkgpath.
    # git URL, head="HEAD":: a git checkout of the respective head to pkgpath
    # svn URL:: a SVN checkout of the URL to pkgpath
    # darcs URL, tag=nil:: a Darcs checkout of the repo (possibly of a
    #                      tag) to pkgpath
    tar_gz "http://rubyforge.org/frs/download.php/30048/mongrel-1.1.3.tgz"

    # Optional build commands, run in pkgpath
    build "ruby setup.rb config"
    build "ruby setup.rb setup"

    # A optional "hookin add" call, defaulting to "hookin add $pkgpath
    # $pkgpath/lib" if not mentioned.
    hookin pkgpath, [pkgpath+"/lib", pkgpath+"/ext/http11"]

== RubyPorts port naming conventions

* foo.rport will install the current development branch from the repository.
* foo-VERSION.rport will install a release VERSION.

== RubyPorts versioning conventions

* foo means any version of foo.
* foo-1.0 means any version of foo prefixed with "1.0".
* foo-1.0... means any version of foo starting from "1.0".
* foo-1.0.1...foo-2 means any version of foo starting from "1.0.1"
  up to, but not including any version starting with 2.

== Caveat user

Please take note of these things:

* RubyPorts is utterly alpha.  There is zero error handling as of now.
  If it breaks you get to keep both pieces.

* Therefore, consider using a hookin.db on its own for RubyPorts.

== Contact

Please mail bugs, suggestions and patches to
<mailto:chneukirchen@gmail.com>.

Git repository ("git send-email" is welcome for patches):
git clone http://git.vuxu.org/rubyports.git
git clone git://github.com/chneukirchen/rubyports.git

Patches contributing a port are welcome *iff*
* the patch only touch/add the desc and PORT.rport files.
* the patch is titled "Added port PORT-VERSION" or "Update port
  PORT-VERSION".
* all dependencies are already in RubyPorts or contributed as well.

* Michael Fellinger, for help with development.
* pkgsrc/DarwinPorts/OpenBSD ports/portage for inspiration.
* Paul Feyerabend, for making me open my eyes.
